# Buildspace NFT dApp Project

This project allows a user to mint their own NFTs with on-chain metadata. The smart contract generates random three-word combinations out of 30 pre-defined words, random background color out of 6 pre-defined colors for the user to be able to mint NFTs. 

Added features: 
* address blockies
* set a limit on number of NFTs that can be minted.
* display number of NFTs from the collection that have been minted so far. 

TODO: 
* add support for ENS reverse records. 
* display generated NFTs on the client.
