# Buildspace NFT dApp Project

This project allows a user to mint their own NFTs with on-chain metadata. The smart contract generates random three-word combinations out of 30 pre-defined words, random background color out of 6 pre-defined colors for the user to be able to mint NFTs. Added features: address blockie, set a limit on number of NFTs that can be minted, and display number of NFTs from the collection that have been minted so far. TODO: add support for ENS reverse records, display generated NFTs on the client besides linking URLs to OpenSea. Access the site [here](https://nftportal.netlify.app/)
